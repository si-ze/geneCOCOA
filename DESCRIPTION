Description: Gene-COCOA provides insights on the association networks of a gene of interest (GOI) whilst avoiding common artefacts arising from gene expression data.Gene-COCOA takes a list of curated gene sets as an input and ranks them according to their strength of association with the GOI. From each gene set, n genes are sampled as predictor variables in a linear regression modelling the expression of the GOI as the outcome variable. For bootstrapping, this procedure is repeated 1k times. The resulting model errors are compared in a t-test. Gene sets with adjusted P-values of <0.05 model the GOI expression better than random.
